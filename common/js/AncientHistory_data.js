{description: "Often given the attribution of the 'first civilization' (defined as a large static population with clear and permanent division of labor supporting a ruling class or group), Sumer was created in southern Mesopotamia (around the Tigris and Euphrates rivers), probably by migrants from the more northern Samarra culture.

{description: "Writing has a long and complex history, and at this time writing in clay existed longer than writing on paper or cloth has. It followed the use of seals for simple communication and ownership, and probably arose from the need to keep accounts or trade. Earliest examples of writing are lists of ownership or trade.

{description: "Seals, stamps that indicate authorship, ownership or contents, are the earliest surviving form of written language, most likely the precursor to writing. Seals are found in most of the ancient Old World cultures, and much of what we know of some early civilizations come from stone stamps such as shown here. These are from the Indus Valley (modern Pakistan) civilization, and appear to be seals used for signing a document or claiming ownership, probably. This Indus Valley civilization had many large cities, rivaling those of ancient China and Egypt, that disappeared perhaps from drought or a change in the path of the Indus River.
