Little had been knows about human ancestors until Louis Leakey led British Museum-sponsored expedition there in 1931.

Although skulls get most of the public attention, tools such as this chopping tool tell us more about the brains and abilities of these early ancestors than most bones. Although the discovery of this tool by Leakey was greeted at first by skepticism, it is now accepted as one of the oldest hominid tools, and the techniques for creating and using the tools are well documented.
