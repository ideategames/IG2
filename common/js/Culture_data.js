This is known as the Doppler Effect, first explained by Christian Doppler. Doppler loved to watch trains and decided that the waves are compressed in front of a train as it releases each sound bit closer to the hearer than the previous one, and the waves are elongated when the train moves away from us. He then postulated the same for light, and this became the most important tool of astronomy, to measure the speed of stars moving toward or away from us, giving us the data that led to the big bang theory.", objects: "Doppler Effect;waves are compressed when the source moves towards us, expanded when the source moves away;foundation of measuring expansion of the universe;trains sound higher pitch when moving toward us and lower when moving away", location: "Austria", date: "1848", actor: "Christian Doppler", category: "physics", image: "Doppler_effect_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_peterhermesfurian"},
{description: "Scientists at the time believed that disease was caused by the spontaneous generation of bacteria or other organisms from spoilage, 'bad' air (miasma), or other rot. Louis Pasteur did not believe that, having already discovered that yeast used to ferment beer and wine are present everywhere, especially in the air. He first proved that bacteria were also in the air, and merely had to be concentrated (by sucking air through a cotton filter) to grow. Then he showed that bacteria never form in a sterile environment. Thus he created the germ theory of disease, the most important pillar of medicine today.", objects: "germ theory of disease;no spontaneous generation of bacteria;bacteria are in the air", location: "France", date: "1856", actor: "Louis Pasteur", category: "medicine", image: "Germ_theory_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_yupiramos"},
{description: "The most important theory in biology today is the theory of Evolution. Although contested by some religious extremists, this theory has so much evidence that it is often (incorrectly) called fact. It was discovered by a brilliant leap of thinking from data by Charles Darwin (and at the same time by Alfred Russell Wallace) after minute and careful observartion of the variation in closely related species, especially the finches of the Galapagos Islands, when he joined the idea with the extreme age of the earth as postulated by Charles Lyell, published in the most famous science text, 'The Origin of Species'. Species change constantly, and when the are isolated or their environment changes, or move into new environments, they either fit or die out. Some fit well, and those who fit best produce more offspring.", objects: "evolution;finches of Galapagos Island;Voyage of the Beagle;Origin of Species", location: "England", date: "1858", actor: "Charles Darwin", category: "evolution, biology", image: "Evolution_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_redrockerz"},
{description: "When Darwin proposed evolution acting through inherited traits, he did not know how that inheritance worked.

{description: "For a long time, scientists did not believe that life could be sustained without sunlight, so assumed the sea floor was lifeless. Charles Thomson was dredging the sea floor off Norway as part of laying telegraph cable, and pulled up strange fish and other creatures. No one believed him, assumed they were caught on the way down or up. He finally convinced the Royal Navy to dredge systematically over 3 summers, and proved his point, that strange but very real fish and molluscs and plants lived on the floor of the deep sea, beyond the reach of sunlight.", objects: "lightless ocean floor contains life", location: "Scotland", date: "1870", actor: "Charles Thomson", category: "biology", image: "Deep_sea_life_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://wallpho.com/73600-deep-sea-photography-id-42345.htm"},
{description: "Dmitri Mendeleyev was a chemist frustrated by the lack of any organizing principles in the elements, thought that there must be in nature, and tried to discover them. He made cards for each of the known elements with their characteristics (weight, how they combined with carbon hydrogen and oxygen, and their room-temperature state, other things) and tried to arrange them in some kind of recurring pattern. When they didn't fit, he realized there must be other elements not yet discovered, so created 'holes' and the periodic table of elements was born.", objects: "periodic table of elements;first organizing principles of basic earth elements", location: "Russia", date: "1880", actor: "Dmitri Mendeleyev", category: "chemistry, physics", image: "Periodic_table_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_conceptw"},
{description: "Cells were known for over a century before dyes were discovered that would highlight structures inside cells.

{description: "X-rays were discovered by accident. Wilhelm Roentgen was doing research passing a electricity thorugh a variety of gasses and noticed incidentally that a photographic plate buried deep in a desk drawer had the image of a key on it.

{description: "Karl Landsteiner was a doctor who did autopsies at a Vienna hospital. He noticed one day that 4 patients had died during surgery and all of them died of their own blood clotting. They had all been given transfusions. Landsteiner then tested blood from 20 random patients to see how they reacted to each other and discovered that some clotted when combined, and some did not. He further noticed that those that did not clot with each other would not clot with a set of others -- they all had the same blood type, which he had discovered. Humans have 4 blood types (A, B, AB, O), cows have over 800 blood types.", objects: "A, B, AB, O;blood types;necessary before transfusions!", location: "Austria", date: "1897", actor: "Karl Landsteiner", category: "medicine, biology", image: "Blood_types_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_chatchonjira"},
{description: "Cathode ray tubes emit rays that were not understood for a long time. J.J. Thomson set up experiments to determine what they were. He discovered that when they hit a metal plate, the metal plate took on a negative charge. He discovered that the rays could be deflected by both magnets and by electrical fields. By moving those close to a slit where the cathode ray emerged, the place the ray hit the metal or phosphorus plate. He then calculated the mass of these 'electrons' by F=ma, measuring how much force moves the electrons how far.

{description: "Viruses are the smallest life forms yet also some of the most deadly, including not only flu but flu, rabies, yellow fever, Ebola, AIDS. They puzzled Pasteur because he could not isolate them, they were too small to catch on any filter to grow and too small to see. Dmitri Ivanovsky was not able to isolate the organism, but did isolate fluid that contained it, and showed that diseases were carried from organism to organism through fluid the same as most bacteria. Because they were so small, the medical community did not believe in their existence until the experiments were repeated by American surgeon Walter Reed studying yellow fever.", objects: "viruses;smallest life forms on earth;reproduce only by infecting a host cell and directing it to reproduce the infection;colds, yellow fever, rabies", location: "Russia", date: "1898", actor: "Dmitri Ivanovsky", category: "medicine, biology", image: "Viruses_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_psim"},
{description: "Mitochondria is DNA (though this was not known until 65 years after their discovery) that is not in the nucleus of a cell, and is not passed down through sexual reproduction. Instead, it floats in the cell body in its own organelle, and is passed along as an exact copy from mother to offspring in animals.  These were discovered by Carl Benda after microscopes became powerful enough and DNA staining became robust. Mitochondrial DNA are used to date species divergence because they do not change except by random mutation, not by adaptation and inheritance in the usual way. Their role is to create energy for the cell.", objects: "DNA outside the cell nucleus;mitochondria;energy provider for a cell", location: "Germany", date: "1898", actor: "Carl Benda", category: "biology", image: "Mitochondria_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.ideategames.org/"},
