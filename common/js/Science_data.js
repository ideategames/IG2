{description: "For a long time, scientists did not believe that life could be sustained without sunlight, so assumed the sea floor was lifeless. Charles Thomson was dredging the sea floor off Norway as part of laying telegraph cable, and pulled up strange fish and other creatures. No one believed him, assumed they were caught on the way down or up. He finally convinced the Royal Navy to dredge systematically over 3 summers, and proved his point, that strange but very real fish and molluscs and plants lived on the floor of the deep sea, beyond the reach of sunlight.", objects: "lightless ocean floor contains life", location: "Scotland", date: "1870", actor: "Charles Thomson", category: "biology", image: "Deep_sea_life_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://wallpho.com/73600-deep-sea-photography-id-42345.htm"},
{description: "Dmitri Mendeleyev was a chemist frustrated by the lack of any organizing principles in the elements, thought that there must be in nature, and tried to discover them. He made cards for each of the known elements with their characteristics (weight, how they combined with carbon hydrogen and oxygen, and their room-temperature state, other things) and tried to arrange them in some kind of recurring pattern. When they didn't fit, he realized there must be other elements not yet discovered, so created 'holes' and the periodic table of elements was born.", objects: "periodic table of elements;first organizing principles of basic earth elements", location: "Russia", date: "1880", actor: "Dmitri Mendeleyev", category: "chemistry, physics", image: "Periodic_table_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_conceptw"},
{description: "Cells were known for over a century before dyes were discovered that would highlight structures inside cells. Specifically, Walther Fleming discovered that a coal-tar-based dye stained stringlike substances inside the nucleus of cells, and through a series of time-lapse-like microscopic images (the dye killed the cells) he was able to see and draw cell division.", objects: "mitosis;cell division;chromatin;process by which cell chromosomes split", location: "Germany", date: "1882", actor: "Walther Flemming", category: "biology", image: "Cell_division_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.ideategames.org/"},
{description: "X-rays were discovered by accident. Wilhelm Roentgen was doing research passing a electricity thorugh a variety of gasses and noticed incidentally that a photographic plate buried deep in a desk drawer had the image of a key on it. The key had been in another drawer, and he was able to trace back the direct path to one of the experimental tubes. He then tried putting his hand between the electrified gas and a different plate, and was amazed to see his bones.", objects: "X-rays;high frequency radiation goes through flesh but not bone", location: "Germany", date: "1895", actor: "Wilhelm Roentgen", category: "physics, medicine", image: "X_rays_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_vampy1"},
{description: "Karl Landsteiner was a doctor who did autopsies at a Vienna hospital. He noticed one day that 4 patients had died during surgery and all of them died of their own blood clotting. They had all been given transfusions. Landsteiner then tested blood from 20 random patients to see how they reacted to each other and discovered that some clotted when combined, and some did not. He further noticed that those that did not clot with each other would not clot with a set of others -- they all had the same blood type, which he had discovered. Humans have 4 blood types (A, B, AB, O), cows have over 800 blood types.", objects: "A, B, AB, O;blood types;necessary before transfusions!", location: "Austria", date: "1897", actor: "Karl Landsteiner", category: "medicine, biology", image: "Blood_types_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_chatchonjira"},
{description: "Cathode ray tubes emit rays that were not understood for a long time. J.J. Thomson set up experiments to determine what they were. He discovered that when they hit a metal plate, the metal plate took on a negative charge. He discovered that the rays could be deflected by both magnets and by electrical fields. By moving those close to a slit where the cathode ray emerged, the place the ray hit the metal or phosphorus plate. He then calculated the mass of these 'electrons' by F=ma, measuring how much force moves the electrons how far. These were TINY, the first sub-atomic particles discovered.", objects: "electron;first particle of atoms discovered;negative charges in atoms", location: "England", date: "1897", actor: "J.J.

{description: "Viruses are the smallest life forms yet also some of the most deadly, including not only flu but flu, rabies, yellow fever, Ebola, AIDS. They puzzled Pasteur because he could not isolate them, they were too small to catch on any filter to grow and too small to see. Dmitri Ivanovsky was not able to isolate the organism, but did isolate fluid that contained it, and showed that diseases were carried from organism to organism through fluid the same as most bacteria. Because they were so small, the medical community did not believe in their existence until the experiments were repeated by American surgeon Walter Reed studying yellow fever.", objects: "viruses;smallest life forms on earth;reproduce only by infecting a host cell and directing it to reproduce the infection;colds, yellow fever, rabies", location: "Russia", date: "1898", actor: "Dmitri Ivanovsky", category: "medicine, biology", image: "Viruses_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.123rf.com/profile_psim"},
{description: "Mitochondria is DNA (though this was not known until 65 years after their discovery) that is not in the nucleus of a cell, and is not passed down through sexual reproduction. Instead, it floats in the cell body in its own organelle, and is passed along as an exact copy from mother to offspring in animals.  These were discovered by Carl Benda after microscopes became powerful enough and DNA staining became robust. Mitochondrial DNA are used to date species divergence because they do not change except by random mutation, not by adaptation and inheritance in the usual way. Their role is to create energy for the cell.", objects: "DNA outside the cell nucleus;mitochondria;energy provider for a cell", location: "Germany", date: "1898", actor: "Carl Benda", category: "biology", image: "Mitochondria_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.ideategames.org/"},
{description: "Marie Curie was a woman scientist in the days when women could not be professionals. She worked in the lab of her professor husband and discovered radium and plutonium as elements in addition to uranium in a substance called pitchblend. She noticed that too much radiation was coming from this substance to be uranium only, and gradually isolated the others to account for the extra radiation. She was the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize, and one of only 4 people ever to receive the Nobel Prize twice.", objects: "radioactivity;polonium and radium from pitchblende;discocvery of radium", location: "France", date: "1901", actor: "Marie Curie", category: "physics", image: "Radioactivity_01.png", topic: "Science", URL: "http://www.ideategames.org/"},
